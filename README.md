# Quantum Energy Propulsion System ideas

## Overview  
This second project explores a **Riemann Tensor-Based Engine** for advanced quantum energy propulsion, leveraging spacetime curvature and quantum mechanics. Inspired by black hole dynamics, the system integrates higher-dimensional interactions to generate energy for propulsion.

   Mimics spacetime curvature to manipulate geodesics for propulsion.  
2. **Quantum Energy Sources:**  
   Utilizes quantum fluctuations (e.g., Casimir effect, Hawking radiation) to extract energy.  
3. **Black Hole-Inspired Dynamics:**  
   Designs based on Kerr metrics to achieve stable spacetime distortions.  

## Applications
