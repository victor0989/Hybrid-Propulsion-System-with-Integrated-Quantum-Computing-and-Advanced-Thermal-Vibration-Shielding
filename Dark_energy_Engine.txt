Dark Energy Quantum Engine Concept - Riemann Tensor and VHDL Implementation

Theoretical Framework:
This concept envisions a propulsion engine leveraging the 4th dimension, inspired by Riemann tensors and quantum mechanics. 
By imitating the curvature and structure of spacetime, the engine mimics the behavior of black holes to generate quantum energy streams for propulsion.

Key Components:
1. Riemann Tensor Definition:
The Riemann curvature tensor encapsulates the intrinsic curvature of a 4-dimensional spacetime. Its components are defined as:
R^i_{jkl} = ∂Γ^i_{jl}/∂x^k - ∂Γ^i_{jk}/∂x^l + Γ^m_{jl}Γ^i_{mk} - Γ^m_{jk}Γ^i_{ml}
Where Γ represents the Christoffel symbols.

2. Propulsion Mechanism:
The engine uses quantum energy fluctuations stabilized through a tesseract-inspired geometry, allowing controlled manipulation of spacetime curvature.

3. VHDL Implementation Overview:
The equations of the Riemann tensor can be translated into a VHDL-based computational model for hardware simulation of spacetime curvature effects.
