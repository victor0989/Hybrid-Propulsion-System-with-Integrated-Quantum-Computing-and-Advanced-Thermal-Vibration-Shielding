*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The isentropic efficiency of the intake is denoted by (ηd), which is static-to-total 
efficiency and is a measure for the losses from the far upstream conditions to the 
end of inlet (it is the fan/compressor face for turbine or shaft-based engines and the 
inlet of combustion chamber for ram-based engines). The efficiency is then 
expressed by the following relation (refer to Fig. 8.38):

ηd = (h02s - h1) / (h02 - h1)
    = (T02s - T1) / (T02 - T1)
    = (T02s/T1 - 1) / (T02/T1 - 1)
∴ ηd = (rd)^(γ−1/γ) * [ (1 + (γ−1)/2 * M1^2) / (1 + (γ−1)/2 * M1^2) ]

(8.2) Stagnation pressure ratio is then expressed as

rd = P02 / P01 =
     [ 1 + ηd * (γ−1)/2 * M1^2 ]^(γ / (γ−1)) /
     [ 1 + (γ−1)/2 * M1^2 ]^(γ / (γ−1))


1. The working fluid (which usually consists of chemical reaction products) is 
   homogeneous in composition.
2. All the species of the working fluid are treated as gaseous. Any condensed 
   phases (liquid or solid) add a negligible amount to the total mass.
3. The working fluid obeys the perfect gas law.
4. There is no heat transfer across any and all gas-enclosure walls; therefore, the 
   flow is adiabatic.
5. There is no appreciable wall friction and all boundary layer effects may be 
   neglected.
6. There are no shock waves or other discontinuities within the nozzle flow.
7. The propellant flow rate is steady and constant. The expansion of the working 
   fluid is uniform and steady, without gas pulsations or significant turbulence.
8. Transient effects (i.e., start-up and shutdown) are of such short duration that 
   they may be neglected.
9. All exhaust gases leaving the rocket nozzles travel with a velocity parallel to 
   the nozzle axis.
10. The gas velocity, pressure, temperature, and density are all uniform across any 
    section normal to the nozzle axis.
11. Chemical equilibrium is established within the preceding combustion chamber 
    and gas composition does not change in the nozzle (i.e., frozen composition 
    flow).
12. Ordinary propellants are stored at ambient temperatures. Cryogenic propellants 
    are at their boiling points.


h0 = h + v^2 / (2J) = constant

Conservation of energy applied to isentropic flows between any two nozzle axial 
sections x and y shows that the decrease in static enthalpy (or thermodynamic 
content of the flow) appears as an increase of kinetic energy since any changes in 
potential energy may be neglected.

hx − hy = (1/2) * (vy^2 − vx^2) / J = cp * (Tx − Ty)


Specific volume V (i.e., the volume divided by the mass within), at any section:

ṁx = ṁy ≡ ṁ = A * v / V

px * Vx = R * Tx

T0 = T + v^2 / (2 * cp * J)   (3–8)


Relationship of area ratio, pressure ratio, and temperature ratio as functions 
of Mach number in a converging/diverging nozzle depicted for the subsonic and 
supersonic nozzle regions.

The nozzle area ratio for isentropic flow may now be expressed in terms of Mach 
numbers for two arbitrary locations x and y within the nozzle. Such a relationship is 
plotted in Fig. 3–1 for Mx = 1.0, where Ax = At the throat or minimum area, along 
with corresponding ratios for T/T0 and p/p0. In general,

Ay / Ax = (Mx / My) * sqrt{ [1 + ((k−1)/2) * My^2] / [1 + ((k−1)/2) * Mx^2] }^( (k+1)/(k−1) )
